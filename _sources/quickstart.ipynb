    "## Installing\n",
    "Open a terminal and run `pip install regularizepsf`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the technique\n",
    "The basic premise of this technique is to model the point spread function of an imager using stars as our point sources. \n",
    "Then, we calculate the inverse PSF and apply it by multiplying in Fourier space as this is equivalent to convolving in image space. Instead\n",
    "of simply calculating the inverse PSF directly, we also include a \"target PSF\" model to make the resulting corrected\n",
    "stars uniform. This target is typically a Gaussian as shown below in the example. See [theory](theory.md) for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo: correcting DASH image\n",
    "This tutorial uses an image from the Demonstration Airglow-Subtracted Heliospheric\n",
    "imager (DASH) as an example. For details on DASH see Section 4.2 of the [accompanying paper](`https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221202594H`).\n",
    "Here is a visualization of the result we're aiming to produce. \n",

    "Image patches in a DASH image before and after PSF regularization. Left: Stars in each region exhibit a varying PSF before correction. Right: After application of a transfer PSF, the stars are more uniform across the image.  The panels are gamma-corrected to highlight the periphery of the\n",
    "    original and regularized PSFs\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Defining input parameters\n",
    "Before you can correct an image, you need a PSF model for the system that collected the image. \n",
    "You can either define a **functional model** or an **array model.** A functional\n",
    "model is defined by an equation whereas an array model uses the data directly as the model. \n",
    "For most purposes, we recommend an array model because deriving the correct functional form \n",
    "can be tricky. Thus, this quickstart tutorial walks through the array model PSF model form.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to define both the `psf_size` and the `patch_size`. This technique breaks the image into \n",
    "overlapping square neighborhoods of length `patch_size` on each side. In this case a `patch_size` of 256 indicates we use a `256x255` neighborhood size. However, we know for \n",
    "this instrument that the PSF is more compact than this, i.e. a star will not contribute light over the full neighborhood. \n",
    "For computational efficiency reasons, we thus use a `psf_size` of `32x32`. For each star, a box centered on the star\n",
    "of size `32x32` pixels is extracted. These are averaged to create the PSF model. The region outside the `32x32` box but \n",
    "within `256x256` pixel window is filled with the median of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to set the target PSF model's parameters. In this case, we will simply use a \n",
    "symmetric Gaussian and thus have one parameter: the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM). We set this at 3.25 pixels. \n",
    "```py\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from astropy.io import fits\n",
    "from regularizepsf import CoordinatePatchCollection, simple_psf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the parameters and image to use\n",
    "psf_size = 32\n",
    "patch_size = 256\n",
    "target_fwhm = 3.25\n",
    "image_fn = \"data/DASH.fits\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the target PSF\n",
    "We first create a target PSF model by defining\n",
    "a Python function that has inputs of `x` and `y` and outputs the value of the PSF at `(x,y)`. \n",
    "This is a functional model and is thus decorated with the `simple_psf` decorator. We evaluate the model over the full \n",
    "patch size. \n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Define the target PSF\n",
    "center = patch_size / 2\n",
    "sigma = target_fwhm / 2.355\n",
    "\n",

    "def target(x, y, x0=center, y0=center, sigma_x=sigma, sigma_y=sigma):\n",
    "    return np.exp(-(np.square(x - x0) / (2 * np.square(sigma_x)) + np.square(y - y0) / (2 * np.square(sigma_y))))\n",
    "\n",
    "target_evaluation = target(*np.meshgrid(np.arange(patch_size), np.arange(patch_size)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the ArrayCorrector\n",
    "Everything else is handled in the `find_stars_and_average` method on the `CoordinatePatchCollection`. \n",
    "It takes a list of images, the `psf_size`, and the `patch_size`. The function's signature is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{eval-rst}\n",
    ".. autofunction:: regularizepsf.fitter.CoordinatePatchCollection.find_stars_and_average\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We convert from a `CoordinatePatchCollection` object\n",
    "to an `ArrayCorrector` using the `to_array_corrector` method. It requires an evaluated target PSF, which we constructed\n",
    "in the previous section.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Extract all the stars from that image and create a PSF model with a target PSF\n",
    "array_corrector =  CoordinatePatchCollection.find_stars_and_average([image_fn], \n",
    "                                                                     psf_size, \n",
    "                                                                     patch_size).to_array_corrector(target_evaluation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performing the correction\n",
    "Now we have all the components. It's time to correct the image! We open it as a `numpy` array and then use the\n",
    "`array_corrector` to correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "The image data type *must be* float. Otherwise, you will receive a somewhat cryptic error about DTYPEs not matching. \n",
    "It also must match the endianness of your computer. This can be a problem as many computers are little-endian but FITS\n",
    "images are stored big-endian. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Load the image for correcting\n",
    "with fits.open(image_fn) as hdul:\n",

    "# See the corrected result! \n",
    "corrected = array_corrector.correct_image(data, alpha=2.0, epsilon=0.3)\n",
